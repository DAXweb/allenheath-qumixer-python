# allenheath-qumixer-python
Fast and not so much tested python code for send and receive command with an Allen Heath Qu-Mixer. 
I tested the code with my Qu-16 Mixer. 
Right now the programm can read all the command sent by the mixer with the midi nrpn protocol.
Accept also input from stdin for send custom command.
Note: this a fast and raw implementation. It's not so much refactored and probably there are bugs.
Anyway..in my test it work well.
